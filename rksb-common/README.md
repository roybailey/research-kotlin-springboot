# Common

**Common Code Modules**

## Design

Keep common libraries in one place, built together in the same project version.

* Use multi-modules to create common libraries projects that encapsulate code and dependencies

## Getting started

* `mvn clean install` 

### Prerequisites

* Docker, used by test-containers for testing 3rd party databases

### Modules

See module `README` files for specifics

Module        | Description
------------- | ------------- 
`rksb-lib`    | Libraries and starter packs
`rksb-bom`    | Bill of Materials for versioning all common libraries
